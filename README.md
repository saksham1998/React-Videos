# VideoBuzz
Simple Youtube clone built on top of React JS using Youtube Data API. 

# Functioning
Type video name/category in search bar and get 5 video recommendation in that category.


Tiles on top of the screen for major  categories like comedy,sports,new ,music etc.

CLick on the video for playing it.

# Caveats
Youtube API has a limit on api hits per day.So, It may be possible that the vidoes won't show on your input.
   
   Two ways to solve it:
    1: Wait for a day.
    2: Generate your own API key.
   
# Cloning and Generating the API key
1 : Clone the repo and change the name of the project to be unique. Go to Google Developer Console and generate new project.
2: Under the section of API's, choose "youtube data api v3" and activate it.
3: Fill in basic details like name of the app,usage type etc and generate the key.

After generation of the key, go to src/api/youtube.js file and change the key to yours and start working on your take of project :)
